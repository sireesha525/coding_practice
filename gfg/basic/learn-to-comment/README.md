## Problem

Given three lines that print the values of  **a**,  **b**, and  **c.**   **Comment**  out the line that prints the value of b.

Comments are useful in any programming language to describe the purpose of functions or operations. They are ignored by the compiler, so they do not affect the execution of the code.

 **Examples:**  

```
Input: a = 5, b = 6, c = 15
Output:
5
15
```

```
Input:a = 6, b = 8, c = 10
Output:
6
10
```

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a;
    int b;
    int c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    // Prints a
    cout << a << endl;

    // Prints b
    //cout << b << endl;

    // Prints c
    cout << c << endl;
}
```
