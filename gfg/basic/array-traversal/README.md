![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

You are given an array  **arr[]**  that contains integers. You need to print the elements of the array in a single line with a space between them.
Note: Don't add a new line at the end.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [54, 43, 2, 1, 5]
Output: 54 43 2 1 5
Explanation: Just traverse and print the numbers.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [324, 5, 2, 2]
Output: 324 5 2 2

        }
