# Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer `num`, return  *the number of steps to reduce it to zero*.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by `2`, otherwise, you have to subtract `1` from it.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: num = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4. 
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: num = 123
Output: 12

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= num <= 106

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSteps(int num) {
        int count=0;
        while(num!=0){
            if (num%2==0){
                num=num/2;
            }
            else{
                num=num-1;
            }
        count++;
        }
    return count; 
    }
}
```
