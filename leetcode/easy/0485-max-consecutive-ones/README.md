## Problem

Given a binary array `nums`, return  *the maximum number of consecutive* `1` *'s in the array*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

        max_count=0
        for num in nums:
            if num==1:
                current_count += 1
                max_count=max(max_count,current_count)
            else:
                current_count=0
        return max_count

        
```
