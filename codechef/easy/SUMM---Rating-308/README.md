## Problem

### Sum it

Bob received an assignment from his school: he has two numbers $A$ and $B$, and he has to find the sum of these two numbers.
Alice, being a good friend of Bob, told him that the answer to this question is $C$.
Bob doesn't completely trust Alice and asked you to tell him if the answer given by Alice is correct or not.
If the answer is correct print `"YES"`, otherwise print `"NO"` (without quotes).

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case consists of three space-separated integers $A, B,$ and $C$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the answer: `YES` if Alice gave the right answer, and `NO` otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the outputs `Yes`, `YES`, `yEs` and `yes` will be treated as equivalent.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq A, B, C \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1 2 3
4 5 9
2 3 6
```

```
YES
YES
NO
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  $1+2 = 3$, so Alice's answer is correct.

 **Test case $2$:**  $4+5 = 9$, so Alice's answer is correct.

 **Test case $3$:**  $2+3=5$ which doesn't equal $6$, so Alice's answer is incorrect.
