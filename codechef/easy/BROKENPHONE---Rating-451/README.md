## Problem

### Broken Phone

Uttu broke his phone. He can get it repaired by spending $X$ rupees or he can buy a new phone by spending $Y$ rupees. Uttu wants to spend as little money as possible. Find out if it is better to get the phone repaired or to buy a new phone.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ — the cost of getting the phone repaired and the cost of buying a new phone.
### Output Format

For each test case,

- output REPAIR if it is better to get the phone repaired.
- output NEW PHONE if it is better to buy a new phone.
- output ANY if both the options have the same price.

You may print each character of `REPAIR`, `NEW PHONE` and `ANY` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `any`, `ANy`, `Any` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \le X, Y \le 10^4$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
100 1000
10000 5000
3000 3000

```

```
REPAIR
NEW PHONE
ANY

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  It is better to get the phone repaired since $100 \lt 1000$.

 **Test Case 2:**  It is better to buy a new phone since $10000 \gt 5000$.

 **Test Case 3:**  Uttu can choose either of the two options since $3000 = 3000$.

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Read the number of test cases
        if (scanner.hasNextInt()) {
            int t = scanner.nextInt();

            while (t-- > 0) {
                int x = scanner.nextInt(); // Cost of repair
                int y = scanner.nextInt(); // Cost of new phone

                // Compare costs and print the appropriate output
                if (x < y) {
                    System.out.println("REPAIR");
                } else if (x > y) {
                    System.out.println("NEW PHONE");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("ANY");
                }
            }
        }
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
