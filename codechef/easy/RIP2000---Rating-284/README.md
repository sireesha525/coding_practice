Chef wants to pay the same amount using Rs. $500$ notes only. Find the number of notes Chef needs.

### Input Format

Each test case consists of a single integer $N$ - the number of notes of Rs. $2000$ that Chef has collected.

### Explanation:

$4$ notes of Rs. $2000$ make a total of $4 \cdot 2000 = 8000$ rupees. This is equivalent to $16$ notes of Rs. $500$.
