## Problem

### Ezio and Guards

Ezio can manipulate  **at most**  $X$ number of guards with the apple of eden.

Given that there are $Y$ number of guards, predict if he can safely manipulate all of them.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers $X$ and $Y$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print $\texttt{YES}$ if it is possible for Ezio to manipulate all the guards. Otherwise, print $\texttt{NO}$.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings $\texttt{YeS}$, $\texttt{yEs}$, $\texttt{yes}$ and $\texttt{YES}$ will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
5 7
6 6
9 1
```

```
NO
YES
YES
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Ezio can manipulate at most $5$ guards. Since there are $7$ guards, he cannot manipulate all of them.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Ezio can manipulate at most $6$ guards. Since there are $6$ guards, he can manipulate all of them.

 **Test Case $3$:**  Ezio can manipulate at most $9$ guards. Since there is only $1$ guard, he can manipulate the guard.

	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc=new Scanner (System.in);
		int t=sc.nextInt();
		while(t-->0){
		    int x=sc.nextInt();
		    int y=sc.nextInt();
		    if(y>x){
		        System.out.println("NO");
		    }
		    else{
		        System.out.println("YES");
		    }
