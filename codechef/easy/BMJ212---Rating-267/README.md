## Problem

### Debug this code - Determine the Score

The code given in the IDE is incorrect - Try and debug this program!!!

There is a problem worth $X$ points and it has $10$ test cases.
It is known that $X$ is a multiple of $10$.
It is known that each test case is worth the same number of points.
You pass $N$ test cases among them. Determine the score that you will get.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers $X$ and $N$, the total points for the problem and the number of test cases which pass.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the points scored by you.

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
10 3
100 10
```

```
3
100
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  The problem is worth $10$ points and since there are $10$ test cases, each test case is worth $1$ point. Since you pass $3$ test cases, your score will be $1 \cdot 3 = 3$ points.

 **Test Case $2$:**  The problem is worth $100$ points and since there are $10$ test cases, each test case is worth $10$ points. Since you pass all the $10$ test cases, your score will be $10 \cdot 10 = 100$ points.

```java
// The code below is incorrect. Debug the code to solve the problem
import java.util.Scanner;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args)
	{
		Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int t = read.nextInt();
		for(int i=0; i<t; i++)
		{
    		int x = read.nextInt();
    		int n = read.nextInt();
    		
    	    int points_per_testcase = x /10;
    		int score = points_per_testcase * n;
    		
    		System.out.println(score);
		}
	}
}
```
