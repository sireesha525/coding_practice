## Problem

### Second Max of Three Numbers
### Problem Statement

Write a program that accepts sets of three numbers, and prints the  *second-maximum number*  among the three.

### Input
- First line contains the number of triples, N.
- The next N lines which follow each have three space separated integers.
### Output

For each of the  **N**  triples, output one new line which contains the second-maximum integer among the three.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 6
- 1 ≤ every integer ≤ 10000
- The three integers in a single triplet are all distinct. That is, no two of them are equal.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1 2 3
10 15 5
100 999 500
```

```
2
