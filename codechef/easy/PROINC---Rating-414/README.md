## Problem

### Profit Increment

Chef recently started selling a special fruit.
He has been selling the fruit for $X$ rupees ($X$ is a multiple of $100$). He earns a profit of $Y$ rupees on selling the fruit currently.

Chef decided to increase the selling price by $10\%$. Please help him calculate his new profit after the increase in selling price.

Note that only the selling price has been increased and the buying price is same.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ denoting the initial selling price and the profit respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output a single integer, denoting the new profit.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq Y \leq 100$
- $X$ is a multiple of $100$.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
100 10
200 5
500 10
100 7

```

```
20
25
60
17

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The buying price of the item is the difference of selling price and profit, which is $90$. The new selling price is $10\%$ more than the initial selling price. Thus, the new profit is $110-90 = 20$.

 **Test case $2$:**  The buying price of the item is the difference of selling price and profit, which is $195$. The new selling price is $10\%$ more than the initial selling price. Thus, the new profit is $220-195 = 25$.

 **Test case $3$:**  The buying price of the item is the difference of selling price and profit, which is $490$. The new selling price is $10\%$ more than the initial selling price. Thus, the new profit is $550-490 = 60$.

 **Test case $4$:**  The buying price of the item is the difference of selling price and profit, which is $93$. The new selling price is $10\%$ more than the initial selling price. Thus, the new profit is $110-93 = 17$.

		        int x = sc.nextInt();
		        int y = sc.nextInt();
		        
		        // New profit = Original profit + (10% of initial selling price)
		        int newProfit = y + (x / 10);
		        
		        System.out.println(newProfit);
		    }
