## Problem

### Bull or Bear

Chef is on his way to become the new big bull of the stock market but is a bit weak at calculating whether he made a profit or a loss on his deal.

Given that Chef bought the stock at value $X$ and sold it at value $Y$. Help him calculate whether he made a profit, loss, or was it a neutral deal.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$, denoting the value at which Chef bought and sold the stock respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `PROFIT` if Chef made a profit on the deal, `LOSS` if Chef incurred a loss on the deal, and `NEUTRAL` otherwise.

The checker is case-insensitive so answers like `pROfiT`, `profit`, and `PROFIT` would be considered the same.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 500$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
4 2
8 8
3 4
2 1

```

```
LOSS
NEUTRAL
PROFIT
LOSS

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Since the cost price is greater than the selling price, Chef made a loss in the deal.

 **Test case $2$:**  Since the cost price is equal to the selling price, the deal was neutral.

 **Test case $3$:**  Since the cost price is less than the selling price, Chef made a profit in the deal.

 **Test case $4$:**  Since the cost price is greater than the selling price, Chef made a loss in the deal.

		    if(x>y){
		        System.out.println("LOSS");
		    }
		    else if(x<y){
		        System.out.println("PROFIT");
		    }
