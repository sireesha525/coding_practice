## Problem

### Monthly Budget

Akshat has $X$ rupees to spend in the current month. His daily expenditure is $Y$ rupees, i.e., he spends $Y$ rupees each day.

Given that the current month has $30$ days, find out if Akshat has enough money to meet his daily expenditures for this month.

### Input Format
- The first line will contain $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $X$, $Y$ - the amount of money Akshat has for the current month and his daily expenditure respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES` if Akshat has enough money to meet his daily expenditure for $30$ days of the month, otherwise output `NO`.

You may print each character of `YES` and `NO` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `yes`, `yEs`, `Yes` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 10^5$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1000 10
250 50
1500 50

```

```
YES
NO
YES

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Akshat has $1000$ rupees and he wants to spend $30 \times 10 = 300$ rupees in the entire month. Therefore, he has enough money for the entire month.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Akshat has $250$ rupees and he wants to spend $30 \times 50 = 1500$ rupees in the entire month. Therefore, he does not have enough money for the entire month.

 **Test Case $3$:**  Akshat has $1500$ rupees and he wants to spend $30 \times 50 = 1500$ rupees in the entire month. Therefore, he has enough money for the entire month.
