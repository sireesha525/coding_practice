## Problem

### Debug this code - Pass the Exam

The code in the IDE is incorrect - debug the code to solve this problem!

Chef appeared for an exam consisting of $3$ sections. Each section is worth $100$ marks.
Chef scored $A$ marks in Section $1$, $B$ marks in section $2$, and $C$ marks in section $3$.
Chef passes the exam if both of the following conditions satisfy:

- Total score of Chef is $\geq 100$;
- Score of each section $\geq 10$.

Determine whether Chef passes the exam or not.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing $3$ space-separated numbers $A, B, C$ - Chef's score in each of the sections.
### Output Format

For each test case, output '`PASS`' if Chef passes the exam, '`FAIL`' otherwise.

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
9 100 100
30 40 50

```

```
FAIL
PASS

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Although Chef's total score is $209 \geq 100$, still Chef fails the exam since his score in section $1$ is $\lt 10$.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Chef cleared each section's cutoff as well his total score $= 120 \geq 100$.

		int t = read.nextInt();
		for(int i=0; i<t; i++)
		{
    		int a = read.nextInt();
    		int b = read.nextInt();
    		int c = read.nextInt();
    		
    		int total_score = a+b+c;
    		int minimum_score = Math.min(a, Math.min(b, c));
    		
    		if(total_score>100 && minimum_score>10){
    		    System.out.println("PASS");
    		}
    		else{
    		    System.out.println("FAIL");
    		}
		}
	}
}
```
