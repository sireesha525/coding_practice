## Problem

### Debug this code - Population

The code given in the IDE is incorrect - Try and debug this program!!!

 **Problem statement** 
There were initially $X$ million people in a town, out of which $Y$ million people left the town and $Z$ million people immigrated to this town.
Determine the final population of the town in millions.

- Input format The first line of input will contain an integer $T$ — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $X$, $Y$ and $Z$.
- Output format For each test case, output on a new line the final population of the town
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
3 1 2
2 2 2

```

```
4
2

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The initial population of the town was $3$ million, out of which $1$ million people left and $2$ million people entered the town. So, final population $= 3 - 1 + 2 = 4$ million.

 **Test case $2$:**  The initial population of the town was $2$ million, out of which $2$ million left and $2$ million immigrated. The final population is thus $2+2-2 = 2$ million.

```py
#The code below is incorrect. Debug this code to solve the problem

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    X, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())
    #Variable declared to hold the final population of the town
    total_population = X - Y
    total_population = total_population + Z
    print(total_population)
```
