## Problem

### Four Tickets

Four friends want to attend a concert. Each ticket costs $X$ rupees.
They have decided to go to the concert if and only if the total cost of the tickets does  **not exceed**  $1000$ rupees.

Determine whether they will be going to the concert or not.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single integer $X$, the cost of each ticket.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES` if they will be going to the concert, `NO` otherwise.

You can print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings `YES`, `yes`, `Yes`, and `yES`, are all considered identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \leq 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
100
500
250
1000
```

```
YES
NO
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The total cost of all tickets is $100\cdot 4 = 400$ which is $\le 1000$. Thus, they will go to the concert.

 **Test case $2$:**  The total cost of all tickets is $500\cdot 4 = 2000$ which is $\gt 1000$. Thus, they will not go to the concert.

 **Test case $3$:**  The total cost of all tickets is $250\cdot 4 = 1000$ which is $\le 1000$. Thus, they will go to the concert.

 **Test case $4$:**  The total cost of all tickets is $1000\cdot 4 = 4000$ which is $\gt 1000$. Thus, they will not go to the concert.
