## Problem

### Pending Assignments

Chef has finally decided to complete all of his pending assignments.

There are $X$ assignments where each assignment takes $Y$  **minutes**  to complete.
Find whether Chef would be able to complete all the assignments in $Z$  **days**.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists three space-separated integers $X, Y,$ and $Z$ — the number of assignments, time taken in minutes to complete each assignment, and the number of days in which Chef wants to complete the assignments.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, `YES`, if Chef would be able to complete all the assignments in $Z$  **days**. Otherwise, print `NO`.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `YES`, `yEs`, `yes`, and `yeS` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
- $1 \leq Z \leq 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
5 5 5
50 80 2
20 72 1

```

```
YES
NO
YES
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef needs a total of $5\cdot 5 = 25$ minutes to complete all the assignments. Thus, he would be able to complete the assignments in $5$ days.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef needs a total of $50\cdot 80 = 4000$ minutes to complete all the assignments. However, in $2$ days, he only has $2\cdot 24\cdot 60 = 2880$ minutes.
Thus, he would not be able to complete the assignments in $2$ days.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef needs a total of $20\cdot 72 = 1440$ minutes to complete all the assignments. In $1$ days, he has $24\cdot 60 = 1440$ minutes.
Thus, he would be able to complete the assignments in $1$ day.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Read the number of test cases
        if (scanner.hasNextInt()) {
            int t = scanner.nextInt();
            
            while (t-- > 0) {
                int x = scanner.nextInt();
                int y = scanner.nextInt();
                int z = scanner.nextInt();
                
                // Total minutes needed for assignments
                int totalMinutesNeeded = x * y;
                
                // Total minutes available in Z days (Z * 24 hours * 60 minutes)
                int totalMinutesAvailable = z * 24 * 60;
                
                // Check if Chef can complete the assignments in time
                if (totalMinutesNeeded <= totalMinutesAvailable) {
                    System.out.println("YES");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("NO");
                }
            }
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
