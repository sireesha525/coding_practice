## Problem

### Practice problem - Tuition fees

Let's solve this practice problem.

You will attend tuitions for $X$ weeks, and the cost of tuition per week is $Y$ dollars.
You need to compute and output your total  **tuition fees**.

 **Hint** 

- Refer to the multiplication syntax you learnt in the previous questions
- Run your code on the sample test cases before submitting the same
### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain an integer $T$ — the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$
### Output Format
- For each test case, output on a new line your total tuition fees.
### Sample 1:

            // Accept 2 integers inputs
        	int x = read.nextInt();
        	int y = read.nextInt();
        	System.out.println(x*y);
            // Update your code below this line to solve the problem
