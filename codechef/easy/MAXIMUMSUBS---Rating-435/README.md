## Problem

### Maximum Submissions

A participant can make $1$ submission every $30$ seconds. If a contest lasts for $X$ minutes, what is the maximum number of submissions that the participant can make during it?

It is also given that the participant cannot make any submission in the last $5$ seconds of the contest.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single integer $X$, denoting the number of minutes.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the maximum number of submissions a participant can make in $X$ minutes.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 30$
- $1 \leq X \leq 30$
### Sample 1:

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The contest lasts for $1$ minute, which is $60$ seconds. A participant can make $2$ submissions during this time — for example, in the $5$-th second and in the $48$-th second. Making $3$ or more submissions is impossible.

 **Test case $2$:**  The contest lasts for $2$ minutes, which is $120$ seconds. A participant can make $4$ submissions during this time.
