## Problem

### Final Population

There were initially $X$ million people in a town, out of which $Y$ million people left the town and $Z$ million people immigrated to this town.

Determine the final population of town in millions.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case consists of three integers $X$, $Y$ and $Z$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the final population of the town in millions.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X, Y, Z \leq 10$
- $Y \leq X$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
3 1 2
2 2 2
4 1 8
10 1 10

```

```
4
2
11
19

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The initial population of the town was $3$ million, out of which $1$ million people left and $2$ million people entered the town. So, final population $= 3 - 1 + 2 = 4$ million.

 **Test case $2$:**  The initial population of the town was $2$ million, out of which $2$ million left and $2$ million immigrated. The final population is thus $2+2-2 = 2$ million.
