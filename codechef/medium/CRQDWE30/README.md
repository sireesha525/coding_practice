## Problem

### Currency Exchange Rates and Conversions

A financial institution tracks currency exchange rates and conversions.
In this task, you'll store currency values as `double` and use floating-point division (`/`) to calculate the equivalent value in another currency.

 **Steps to Complete:** 

- Store the result in convertedAmount.
- Print the total amount, exchange rate, and converted amount.

 **Expected Output:** 

```
Total Amount in INR: 100.0  
Exchange Rate (1 USD to INR): 82.5  
Converted Amount in USD: 1.2121212121212122  

```

Write the code and test different exchange rates!

```java
class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare a double variable for total amount in USD
        double totalAmountUSD = 100.0; 

        // Declare a double variable for the exchange rate
        double exchangeRate = 82.5; 
        double convertedAmount = totalAmountUSD / exchangeRate; 

        // Print the values
        System.out.println("Total Amount in INR: " + totalAmountUSD);
        System.out.println("Exchange Rate (1 USD to INR): " + exchangeRate);
        System.out.println("Converted Amount in USD: " + convertedAmount);
    }
}
```
