## Problem

An arcade game machine needs to display a player's high score. You are tasked with writing a small Java program to manage and display this information.

Initially, a player named "RetroGamer" has a high score of 50000 points. After a new game session, "RetroGamer" achieves a new, better high score of 75000 points.

 **Your task is to:** 

- Declare a variable to store the player's name and initialize it with the value "RetroGamer".
- Declare a variable to store the player's high score and initialize it with the value 50000.
- Print the player's name and their initial high score.
- The player has now achieved a new high score. Update the variable storing the high score to the new value of 75000.
- Print the player's name and their new (updated) high score.

 **Expected Output:** 

```
Player: RetroGamer, Initial High Score: <value>
Player: RetroGamer, New High Score: <value>

```

        highScore=75000;
        System.out.println("Player: " + playerName + ", New High Score: " + highScore);
