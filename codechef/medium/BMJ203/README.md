## Problem

### Division with integer and decimal output

Lets focus a bit more on division to clarify the concept

- Division can return an integer value or decimal value, it all depends on which datatype you declare the variables as.

To get an integer output you need to declare the variables as  **`int`** :

```
int a = 3;
int b = 2;
int c = a/b;
System.out.println(c);

// Output: 1

```

To get a decimal output you need to declare the variables as  **`double`** :

```
double a = 3;
double b = 2;
double c = a/b;
System.out.println(c);

// Output: 1.5

```

### Task

In this problem you need to write a program which does the following

- Accepts the number of inputs / test cases as 't' Each line of test case contains 2 integers - declare them as variables $A$ and $B$
- For each test case, you need to perform the following operations Create a variable - $X$ - the division of $A$ and $B$ which returns a decimal value Output the integer $X$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
10 5
10 6
```

```
2.0
1.6666666666666667
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1** : The 2 integers are $10$ and $5$ and we output $2.0$ as the value of $X$

 **Test case 2** : The 2 integers are $10$ and $6$ and we output $1.6666666666666667$ as the value of $X$

import java.util.Scanner;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args)
	{
		Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int t = read.nextInt();
		for(int i=0; i<t; i++)
		{
    		double a = read.nextInt();
    		double b = read.nextInt();
    		
    		// Division of A by B decimal result
    	    double  x = a/b;
    		System.out.println(x);
		}
	}
}
```
