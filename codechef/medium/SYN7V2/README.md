## Problem

### Inserting space between outputs

Listen

If you want the output to be in the same line and have a space separate them,

- We can use " " to act as an empty space in between multiple outputs.
- We had seen previously that text has to be enclosed within double quotes during cout ("text")
- An empty space is a blank space between double quotes (" ")

For example, to print:  **2 2**, we can write

```
cout<< 2 << " " << 2;

```

### Task

Write a program to output 7 and 3 on a single line, space separated, using a single cout statement.

}
