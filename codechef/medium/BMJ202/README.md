## Problem

### Subtraction and division of numbers

While sum and addition of $2$ numbers did not require any specific precautions, we need to be careful during subtraction and division operations

- Subtraction can return a positive or negative value depending on which number is larger
- Division can return an integer or float
### Task

Write a program that does the following

- Accepts the number of inputs / test cases as 't' The only line of each test case contains 2 integers - declare them as variables $A$ and $B$
- For each test case, you need to perform the following operations Create a variable - $D$ - what you get after subtracting $B$ from $A$. Create a variable - $Q$ - the quotient when $A$ is divided by $B$ Output 2 space separated integers - $D$ and $Q$ in a single line

 **Note:**  The inputs have been created such that

- $A$ is necessarily greater than or equal to $B$
- $A$ is necessarily exactly divisible by $B$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
10 5
16 4
```

```
5 2
12 4
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1** : The 2 integers are $10$ and $5$ and we output $5$ as their difference and $2$ as the quotient of their division

 **Test case 2** : The 2 integers are $16$ and $4$ - we output $12$ as their difference and $4$ as the quotient of their division

```java
// Update the '_' below to solve the problem
import java.util.Scanner;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args)
	{
		Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int t = read.nextInt();
		for (int i=0; i<t; i++)
		{
    		int a = read.nextInt();
    		int b = read.nextInt();
    		
    		// Difference of inputs
    		int d = a - b;
    		
    		// Division of inputs.
            int q = a / b;
    		
    		// print the desired output for each test case
    		System.out.println(d + " " + q);
		}
	}
}
```
