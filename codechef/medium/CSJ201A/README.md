## Problem

### Review syntax usage

Let us cover the 'conditional statements' syntax required for solving beginner's programming problems.

### Task

Write a program which does the following

- Accepts the count of test cases - $t$ Each test case has one integer $N$
- Output the following for each test case If input is less than or equal to $100$, output 'Good' If input is greater than 100 but less than or equal to $200$, output 'Better' If the input is greater than 200, output 'Best'
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
100
200
201
```

```
Good
Better
Best
```

```java
// Update the blanks in the code below
import java.util.Scanner;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args)
	{
		Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int t = read.nextInt();
		for(int i=0; i<t; i++)
		{
            // Accept one integer as input
    		int n = read.nextInt();
    		
    		// 1st condition in the problem
    		if(n<=100){
    		    System.out.println("Good");
    		}
    		
    		// 2nd condition in the problem
    		else if(n>100 && n<=200){
    		    System.out.println("Better");
    		}
    		
    		// 3rd condition in the problem
    		else{
    		    System.out.println("Best");
    		}
		}
	}
}

```
