## Problem

### Fuel Consumption Tracker

Write a program to update the remaining fuel in a vehicle after a trip using the  **subtraction assignment (`-=`)**  operator. The program should deduct the fuel consumed from the initial fuel level and display the updated fuel level.

Take two float variables: fuelLevel = 45.5, fuelConsumed = 12.3

 **Expected Output:** 

```
33.2

```

```java
class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Given variables: Initial fuel level and fuel consumed
        float fuelLevel = 45.5f, fuelConsumed = 12.3f;

        // Subtract the fuel consumed using -=
        fuelLevel -= fuelConsumed;

        // Print the updated fuel level
        System.out.println(fuelLevel);  // Prints the remaining fuel level
    }
}


```
