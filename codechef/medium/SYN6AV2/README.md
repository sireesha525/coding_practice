## Problem

### Multiple outputs using a single line

Listen

You can also have multiple outputs together in a single `"cout"` command.
They are joined together using the  **`"<<"`**  symbol.

So, for example,

```
cout << 2;
cout << endl;
cout << 3;

```

and

```
cout << 2 << endl << 3;

```

are equivalent.

### Task

Write a program to output 7 and 3 on two lines, using a single cout statement.

}

```
