## Problem

### Taking Multiple User Inputs

Listen

Similar to how we give multiple outputs, we can also take multiple inputs using the extraction operator(>>).

```
int a, b;
cin >> a >> b;
cout << b << " " << a << endl;

```

In the above code we declare two variables $a$ and $b$ and take input using cin and store the first input in $a$ and the second input in $b$. Thus, for the input:

```
2 3

```

the output will be:

```
3 2

```

Notice that you don't need to specify when to take the next input after a space. cin automatically stops taking input when it encounters a whitespace (like a space, tab, or newline) and then moves on to take the next input after the whitespace.

### Task

Write a program to take three inputs $a$, $b$ and $c$ and output their sum.

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2 4 3
```

```
9
```

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
7 1 2
```

```
10
```

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int a,b,c;
	cin>>a>>b>>c;
	cout<<a+b+c<<endl;

}

```
