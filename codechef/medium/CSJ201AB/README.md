## Problem

### Logical operators & conditional statements

We reviewed basic conditional operators in the previous module.
In this module - we will cover logical operators in conditional statements.

- AND "&&" and OR "||" statements help check multiple conditions
- A single statement can have multiple conditions clubbed together using "&&" and "||". These can be used in if / else conditions.
### Task

You are given 3 integers $N$, $A$ and $B$.
You need to compute and output the following for each test case

- If $N$ is divisible by both $A$ and $B$ - then output 'N is divisible by A and B'
- Else if $N$ is divisible by $A$ and not $B$ - then output 'N is divisible by only A'
- Else if $N$ is divisible by $B$ and not $A$ - then output 'N is divisible by only B'
- Else if $N$ is divisible by neither $A$ nor $B$ - then output 'N is divisible by neither A nor B'

            if(N%A == 0 && N%B == 0){
                System.out.println("N is divisible by A and B");
            }

                System.out.println("N is divisible by only A");
            }
            else if(N%B == 0){
                System.out.println("N is divisible by only B");
            }
            
            // The last statement could have been an 'else' statement
            // elif condition used to show usage of 'and' statement
    		else if(N%A != 0 && N%B != 0){
    		    System.out.println("N is divisible by neither A nor B");
    		}
		}
	}
}
