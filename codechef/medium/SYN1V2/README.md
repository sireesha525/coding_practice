## Problem

### Introduction

Listen

Let us output an integer in C++.

C++ has a few lines of code which we write in almost all programs.
These are the first 4 lines and the last line that you see in the program to your right. We are going to learn about them in some time.

Let's break down this line of code:

- Libraries: #include <iostream> imports the iostream library, providing input/output tools like cout. Think of it as including a toolbox.
- Namespaces: using namespace std; lets you use standard elements like cout directly (instead of std::cout). It's like specifying which set of tools you're using.
- main function: int main() {... } is the core of every C++ program; execution starts here. It's the program's starting point.
- cout: Pronounced as see-out, cout stands for "character output stream". It is used to output data to screen.
- <<: This is the stream insertion operator. It is used with cout to send data to the output stream.
- 12: This is the data we want to print. Here, it's the number 12.

Semicolon is used to end a statement, like period (.) in English.

So, when you write `cout << 12;`, it tells the computer to print the number 12 on screen.
