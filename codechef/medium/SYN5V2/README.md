## Problem

### Outputs In Separate Lines

Listen

When we use multiple cout statements, everything gets printed on one line.

```
cout << 20;
cout << 40;

// Output:
// 2040

```

What to do if we want to print 20 and 40 on separate lines?

We can use  **`<< endl`**  to have the next outputs be on the next line. It is like pressing the Enter / Return key on your keyboard, but for the output displayed.

Example:

```
cout << 20 << endl;
cout << 40 << endl;

// Output:
// 20
// 40

```

### Task

Write a program which does the following

- Output the sum of 3 and 4 using cout.
- Output the sum of 1 and 2 using cout, but on a new line.

 **Expected Output** 

```
7
3

```
