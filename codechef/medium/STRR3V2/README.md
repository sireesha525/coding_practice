## Problem

### Strings and Integers

Listen

C++ uses the  **+**  sign for both `addition` and `concatenation`.

- Numbers are added.
- Strings are concatenated.
- We cannot mix the two.
### Task

You are given a program in the IDE:

- You want to output 2569.
- Try running the given code in the IDE as it is - it will give a Compilation error.
- Fix the error so that both the variables become string and the output is 2569.

## Solution

**Language:** c_cpp  
**Runtime:** N/A  
**Memory:** N/A  
**Submitted:** 2026-09-16T23:35:57.196Z  

```c_cpp
//We need to output 2569 using string concatenation.
//The code below is incorrect - Debug the code to solve the problem

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {

  string num1 = "25";
  string num2 =  "69";
  cout << num1 + num2;

  
}
```
