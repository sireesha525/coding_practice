## Problem

### Global Financial Transactions Tracker

Banks process billions of transactions daily, storing large transaction IDs and branch codes for tracking.
Use  **`long`**  for  **transaction IDs**  due to their size and  **`short`**  for  **branch codes**  as they are smaller values.

```
transactionID = 5_123_456_789_000L;  
branchCode = 3052;  

```

 **Expected Output:** 

```
Transaction ID: 5123456789000  
Branch Code: 3052  

```
