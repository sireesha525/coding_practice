## Problem

### Earthquake Intensity Tracker

Seismologists record earthquake intensity using the `short` data type for its wider range than byte. In this task, you'll declare three variables for intensity across different locations within the short range (`-32,768 to 32,767`).

 **Steps to Complete** 

- Declare a variable named regionOneIntensity using short and assign a positive intensity value 12000.
- Declare another variable named regionTwoIntensity using short and assign a negative intensity value -5000.
- Declare a third variable named regionThreeIntensity using byte and assign a zero intensity value 0.
- Print all three values to confirm they are correctly stored.

Run your code and verify the output. Click "Submit" when you're ready!

 **Expected Output** 
If stored and printed correctly, your output should look something like:

```
Region One Intensity: 12000  
Region Two Intensity: -5000  
Region Three Intensity: 0  

```

Feel free to adjust the intensity values to observe how different earthquake readings affect the results.

```java
class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //  Declare and assign earthquake intensity readings
        short regionOneIntensity = 12000;  // Positive intensity
        short regionTwoIntensity = -5000;  // Negative intensity
        byte regionThreeIntensity = 0;    // Zero intensity

        //  Print the intensity values
        System.out.println("Region One Intensity: " + regionOneIntensity);
        System.out.println("Region Two Intensity: " + regionTwoIntensity);
        System.out.println("Region Three Intensity: " + regionThreeIntensity);
    }
}

```
